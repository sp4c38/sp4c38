Here is a collection of some of my projects:
- **[kniffel](https://github.com/sp4c38/kniffel)**  I always play kniffel with my familiy in the winter break. It's fun! This is a python project which uses pygame to make this cool game playable on your computer.

- **[PizzaApp](https://github.com/sp4c38/PizzaApp)** is a project I'm currently working on. It is a iOS App created using Swift and SwiftUI. It's a project thought for restaurants to make it simple for customers to order pizza and easy for staff to view ordered pizzas.

- **[vertretungsplan-fsg](https://github.com/sp4c38/vertretungsplan-fsg)**  This python project gets the "Vertretungsplan" of my school's website and sends it in a group via telegram. Recently I added a second part which allows a telegram user to interact with the bot and set individual settings.

- **[fortnite_shop](https://github.com/sp4c38/fortnite_shop)** is a python project which downloads the newest shop from the Fortnite game. It outputs an image with all items with their name and price and videos for the items and sends them to a telegram group.
